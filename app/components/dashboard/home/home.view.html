            <p><mark>There is a tale that goes something like this:</mark><br> An old Cherokee told his grandson, “My son, there is a battle
                between two wolves inside us all. One is Evil. It is anger, jealousy, greed, resentment, inferiority, lies,
                and ego. The other is Good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, humility, kindness, empathy, and truth.” The boy
                thought about it, and asked, “Grandfather, which wolf wins?” The old man quietly replied, “The one you feed.”

                In quiet moments, you may have felt it—that tugging feeling in the pit of your stomach or
                in your chest when something is not right. How many times have you known something about a person or situation,
                but ignored it only to have your suspicions confirmed? You may look outside yourself for answers, thinking
                that accessing your inner wisdom engenders mistrust, fear, and doubt, especially when there is no evidence
                to back it up. But you were gifted with this inner “knowingness” and by building a relationship of trust
                with this voice, it can lead to an empowered life filled with desirous outcomes. Start to pay attention,
                and you will slowly begin to hear the different voices or “wolves” within you, and the choice will become
                yours as to which one you will feed.</p>
